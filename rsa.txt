To prevent file sharing outside of class, we can use RSA encryption to make the files as difficult to share as possible. RSA is a fairly simple idea.

We have a hidden key and a public key. With the public key, we can encrypt our files all the same. However, the only way to decyrpt these files is with the hidden key. The best way to manage this would be to have randomly generated hidden keys that must be requested by the student. This is not a guaranteed system by any stretch, but it would at least add a level of complexity on top of the attempted file sharing.
